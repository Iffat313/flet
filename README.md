**1) What is flet?:**
flet is a framework that we can use in python to create mobile or desktop app. Apps are short for applications. Think of apps as little tools on your machine such as a calculator or music.

**2) What is a framework?:**
A framework is like a library where you can import a set of tools. These tools are apart of the oython syntax that can be used to efficently and effectively create said apps. Without these tools, you would have to do everything from scratch. This would cost time, effort, and the complier to be slower.

**3) Okay, what is the purpose of this code?:**
This python script illustrates just one of the many apps you can create with flet. To be specific, the code here is a counter for numbers as a GUI.

**4) What is a GUI?:** 
A GUI, or a "Graphical User Interface", is any sort of text box or graphic that allows user input on the screen.

**5) What was the process here:**

Setting up VScode with python:
- type python into the terminal and donwload the ide from the store. Using the version of python as my interpreter for VScode was required for any .py script to run

Creating a virtual enviorment:
- Inorder to import a library, package, or framework to VScode, you must create a VE.
- You can do so with the following commands in your terminal - WINDOWS OS
- python -m venv .venv
- Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
and then:
.\.venv\Scripts\activate

What's next?:
- You can choose to run the code. Running the code will bring up "flet" as app or through a web browser.
- However, in order for this to work, you must do so following the pictures in the repository.
